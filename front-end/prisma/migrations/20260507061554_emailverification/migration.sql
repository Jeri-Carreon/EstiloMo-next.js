/*
  Warnings:

  - The `emailVerified` column on the `User` table would be dropped and recreated. This will lead to data loss if there is data in the column.
  - You are about to drop the column `identifier` on the `VerificationToken` table. All the data in the column will be lost.
  - Added the required column `email` to the `VerificationToken` table without a default value. This is not possible if the table is not empty.
  - The required column `id` was added to the `VerificationToken` table with a prisma-level default value. This is not possible if the table is not empty. Please add this column as optional, then populate it before making it required.
